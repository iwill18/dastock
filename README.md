# What's The Best Stock?!?
# Final CAT Project
A Stock Market App where you can browse through different stock companies. When stock is clicked from the list, details about the stock appear. The details include the name, symbol, industry, summary about the stock and chart of the stock's numbers.


What was used??
  Jetpack Compose (Building the UI),
  Dagger-Hilt (Dependency Injection),
  OpenCSV (CSV Parsing),
  Retrofit (Remote API),
  Room (Local Caching)


So What's Next??
  I hope to be able to add some more features. Maybe I can add a feature where you can purchase some stock in a particular company or I can add a news tab about the stock market.
